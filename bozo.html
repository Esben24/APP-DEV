<p align="center">
Once there was a bridge I couldn’t cross.<br> 
Cusp of summer. Sound of insects<br> 
carried with me, from Melville’s fields<br> 
in my-heart-on-the-bridge, their zzzz.<br> 
<br> 
Year’s end, now. A theory of edges.<br> 
A vow to complete certain tasks—they will not<br> 
improve me, but dissipate, burn off <br> 
like vapor. I’ve already been too good.<br> 
<br> 
I thought keys would fly out of my pocket<br>  
and then I would have to fly after, <br> 
to enter the terrifying room <br> 
where things blow away to.<br> 
<br> 
Scraps of lists, a paper flower,<br> 
the raspberry clouds of the day’s <br> 
attenuation. A series of signs said <br> 
help was there, but not for me.
